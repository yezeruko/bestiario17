# Autostart plugin #
This [Cordova][cordova] plugin will start automatically your __Android__ app or service after the every boot or the auto-update of your application. You can enable or disable the autostart function in your app. The plugin is also compatible with [PhoneGap Build][PGB].

## Supported Platforms ##
- __Android__
- __macOS__

## Usage ##

#### Enable the automatic startup of your app after the boot ####
```javascript
cordova.plugins.autoStart.enable();
```
Not applicable in macOS.
#### Enable the automatic startup of your service after the boot ####
```javascript
cordova.plugins.autoStart.enableService("yourServiceClassName");
```
In macOS, pass the bundle identifier of a helper application to launch it at startup.
#### Disable the automatic startup of your app and service after the boot ####
This is the default action if you have never called the "enable" function.
```javascript
cordova.plugins.autoStart.disable();
```

#### Indication of automatic startup ####
If the automatic startup has occured, the Android intent includes the attribute "cordova_autostart" with value true. See more instructions to utilize it at related plugins.

#### macOS helper application
Sandboxed macOS applications are not allowed to write arbitrary files, which means that they cannot register themselves as [Launch Agents](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html). Instead, Apple allows the registration of a helper application, embedded in the main app's bundle, to start on boot and launch the main app.

The `enableService` and `disable` actions will register/unregister the helper application to launch on startup. It is the caller's responsibility to implement the helper app. See Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLoginItems.html) for more details.

## Related plugins ##
- [cordova-plugin-intent][plugin-intent] to check out the "cordova_autostart" from extras of Android intent, if your app has automatically started. See more details from [here][stackoverflow_2].
- [cordova-android-movetasktoback][plugin-movetasktoback] to move your app to background
- [cordova-plugin-background-mode][plugin-background-mode] to keep your app running

## Installation ##
The plugin can either be installed from git repository, from local file system through the [Command-line Interface][CLI] or cloud based through [PhoneGap Build][PGB].

#### Local development environment ####
From master:
```bash
# ~~ from master branch ~~
cordova plugin add https://github.com/ToniKorin/cordova-plugin-autostart.git
```
from a local folder:
```bash
# ~~ local folder ~~
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-autostart --searchpath path
```
or to use the latest stable version:
```bash
# ~~ stable version ~~
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-autostart@2.3.0
```

To remove the plug-in, run the following command:
```bash
cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-autostart
```

```xml
<gap:plugin platform="android" name="cordova-plugin-autostart" version="2.3.0" source="npm"/>
```

## Remarks ##
1. Installation to the SD card will prevent the automatic start of your app after the boot. See more details from [here][stackoverflow_1].
2. During the boot your app may start before it has no network connectivity. Your app have to take care of it e.g. using the cordova-plugin-network-information.
